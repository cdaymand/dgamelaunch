# The following two options are fairly insecure. They will force us to

# possible if you decide to use them. dgamelaunch will inform you of
# the uids/gids corresponding to your choices when it loads.
#
# Note that shed_uid and shed_gid will always take precedence over
# shed_user and shed_group if they are specified.

# shed_user: username to shed privileges to
#shed_user = "games"
# shed_group: group name to shed privileges to

# The defaults are usually just fine for this. passwd refers to the file
