-document the exit (error) codes.

-cursor keys are not restored after watching a game of
 curses-nethack.

-move the games[] array into shmem?

-$MTIME(filename)

< Napkin> I'd suggest the default of DGL_MAILMSGLEN to be less
< Napkin> there are 4 digits in front of the prompt, paxed. having
   it at 80, will cause display errors if someone types more than 75 letters
< Napkin> well, to be precise - not the writing - but deleting
   will no longer work, because the cursor won't be moved to the previous
   line again

-when exiting from watching a player, move the cursor to the last line
 of the screen before enabling the ncurses mode; so when we exit dgl,
 the watched player's game is all visible and the menu prompt doesn't
 mess it up.
-watching menu will hilight the first matching username... what if we have
 more than one game installed, and someone's playing more than one at the
 same time?  Should also save game#, not just the username.
-allow admin to disabling the 'm' mail key in ttyplay.
-update README
-maybe allow something like changed_menu="[Updated %d]" config option  and
 $CHANGED in the menu banner.
 the $CHANGED will be replaced with the changed_menu value.
 the %d in changed_menu will be replaced with the banner file
 change time.
-whenever config file has a dir, check that it ends with "/"
-in domailuser(), we need find_curr_player_game(username)
-for menu definitions, allow "default" commands (when user presses a
 key not defined in other commands):
   commands[default] = ...

-change dgl-banner handling; we only use the top line of it nowadays...
 (maybe make that info config line: bannerline = "## $SERVERID" or something)
-allow the admin to config the watching menu:
  -top banner
  -bottom banner
  -remove and reorder the columns:
     watch_title = "   Name      Game  Size   Start date & time  Idle"
       this doesn't allow hiliting the sorted title, though...
     watch_columns = "0) 1  2  3  4 5  6"
       where the numbers correspond to the columns, everything else
       is passed through. the columns have default widths.
       col 0=selectletter, 1=playername, 2=gamenum, 3=termsize, 4=startdate,
           5=starttime, 6=idletime
  -set default sort method
  -selectorchars:
     watch_selectorchars = "abcdefghijklmn" (a-zA-Z, minus qQ)
  -keys:
     currently: qQ=return, '.'=sort++, ','=sort--, etc
-allow admin to set per-game "extra info" file,
   extrainfofile = "/nh343/var/extrainfo/%n.xtranfo"
 contents of which are shown in the watching menu as info-column.
 the game is responsible for updating the contents of that file.

-update virus to the newest version.
 (virus is originally from busybox:
  http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/editors/vi.c
  but that version needs to be made secure)
-allow changing the name where the ttyrecs are saved, like
  ttyrec_fn = "%rttyrec/%n/%g/%p.ttyrec"
-maybe save more stuff in the db, if we're using the sqlite
 (last login timestamp, watch-menu sort-type, etc)
-Allow using a ttyrec (or similar screen capture) as the menu
 text, instead of a text file.
 maybe adding a bannertype={auto,txt,ttyrec,screendump}
 into a menu def. auto=try to detect it from file extension.
 would be useful to be able to define a program to run that
 generates the banner? (eg. nethack hiscore list via nethack itself)
-BUG: cannot quit watching until caught up with the stream.
-allow configuring the watching, new user registration,
 email/passwd change, etc. screens.
-make default_fmode configurable, and add config
 file command "chmod file mode"
-allow setting the new rcfile access rights.
-allow configuring the ttyrec dir location & file format.
-maybe allow changing the watching-screen &c layouts too?
-add commandline parameters to dgamelaunch:
   dgamelaunch --chpasswd "nick" "newpass"
-some games (robotfindskitten?) are not worth saving into ttyrecs,
 make it configurable. if no ttyrecs, then can't watch the game, which is
 a pity. maybe rather just save the latest ttyrec, which ties into
 having configurable ttyrec filenames...
-save the game name into ttyrec filename, so we can find what game it was.
-allow configuring ttyplay.c; some games may use different clear-screen
 commands. (see for example crawl)
-allow configuring the gfx stripping. (number of chars, types of stripping,
 include unicode stripping from crawl dgl, etc.)
 This must be per-game configs; maybe we're running nethack and crawl
 on the same server. ...does ttyplay know what game we're watching?

charstrip "name" {
  start_state = 0;
  state = (0 and 0x0e), 0x00, 1;
  state = (1 and 0x0f), 0x0f, 0;
  state = (1 and 0x1b), 0x1b, 0;
  state = (1 and gfxmap), gfxmap, 1;

  # initializes the gfxmap from charstrip "name" gfxmap. could also have
  # gfxmap_init = zero;
  gfxmap_init = from "name";

  # the following will replace characters 128-135 with the listed characters.
  # accepts:
  # 0xff (hexadecimal), 240 (decimal), 001 (octal), 'x' (character)
  gfxmap = 128, (' ', '|', '#', 0xb3, 0x00, 240, 241);
}


in game definition:
  char_strips = "name", "name", "name", ...
or maybe add a new command '' set_charstrip "name" ''


-public (no-password) accounts? (a per-user flag) what happens when someone
 is playing on the account and someone else logins and we start playing?
-allow users to run recover themselves
-configurable stuff: allowed chars in usernames,
 allow char stripping, ...

- Flags for operators/staff/admins or (optionally) user-bans.

- Localization of variables, code clean up

- Use /var/run/nologin and/or dgl-specific nologin file
