# This is an example nethackrc file. You should edit this to suit the needs
# of your personal nethack build and add some reasonable default options
# for your users.

# If you compiled dgamelaunch with the `vi' editor enabled instead of ee,
# perhaps a helpful blurb such as this might help:

# This editor is vi-like. Type ESC a couple times, then ':q!' (without quotes)
# to exit if you get stuck. To save, hit ESC and then ZZ or type ':wq'
# (without quotes.) To insert text, hit 'i' to enter insert mode.

# Here are some examples of reasonable defaults:

OPTIONS=showexp,showscore,time,color,!autopickup
OPTIONS=autodig,fruit:slime mold,boulder:0
OPTIONS=dogname:NyanDog
OPTIONS=catname:NyanCat
OPTIONS=pickup_types:$
OPTIONS=number_pad

OPTIONS=menucolors
MENUCOLOR=" blessed "=green
MENUCOLOR=" holy "=green
MENUCOLOR=" uncursed "=yellow
MENUCOLOR=" cursed "=red
MENUCOLOR=" unholy "=red
MENUCOLOR=" cursed .* (being worn)"=orange&underline

# Happy hacking!
